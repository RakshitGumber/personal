I added event tracing around allocation and free calls to understand latency spikes under workload bursts.

## Trace Event Format

```json
{
  "name": "alloc",
  "size": 128,
  "timestamp_ns": 6401211
}
```

The first run showed that fragmentation cost was hiding behind bursty request patterns, not average throughput.
