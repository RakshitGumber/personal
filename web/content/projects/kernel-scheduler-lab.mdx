github: "https://github.com/example/kernel-scheduler-lab"
lessons:
  - "Fairness metrics need workload-specific baselines."
  - "Trace logs should be sampled to avoid observer overhead."
  - "Simple queue structures improve debuggability."

This project started as a small experiment to compare round-robin and weighted scheduling under synthetic workloads.

## Development Notes

1. Implemented a baseline run queue with fixed-size arrays.
2. Added event trace markers for dispatch decisions.
3. Exposed per-task wait/runtime stats for post-run analysis.

## Next Iteration

- per-core queue simulation
- lock contention instrumentation
